# Wi‑Fi Automation Pytest Framework (Skeleton)

Minimal pytest framework to organize Wi‑Fi regression: markers, parametrization, and reports.
Use this to show your testing discipline and structure.

## Features
- `pytest.ini` with markers: connectivity, throughput, roaming
- Parametrized tests for bands/auth modes (dummy)
- Allure report hooks (optional; commented)

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
```
